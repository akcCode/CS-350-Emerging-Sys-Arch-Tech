# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

The Milestone Two project used UART serial communication to control LEDs remotely, and the Final Project developed a complete thermostat system using multiple sensors and outputs to monitor and control room temperature.

What did you do particularly well?
I organized the code with a clean state machine approach and maintained good readability throughout both projects.

Where could you improve?
I could improve by double-checking hardware setups before testing to avoid small configuration errors.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I incorporated Adafruitâ€™s CircuitPython libraries, Raspberry Pi official documentation, and draw.io for system diagramming.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
Skills in UART communication, sensor data handling, modular code design, and real-time system control will be very useful for future IoT or robotics projects.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By modularizing functionality, writing clear comments, separating input/output management logically, and following consistent naming conventions.
